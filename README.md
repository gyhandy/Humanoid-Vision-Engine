**Figure:** *Left: Contributions of Shape, Texture, and Color may be different among different scenarios/tasks. 
Right: Humanoid Vision Engine takes dataset as input and summarizes how shape, texture, and color contribute to
the given recognition task in a pure learning manner (E.g., In ImageNet classification,
shape is the most discriminative feature and contributes most in visual recognition).*

**Figure:** *Pipeline for humanoid vision engine (HVE). (a) shows how will humans’ vision
system deal with an image. After humans’ eyes perceive the object, the different parts
of the brain will be activated. The human brain will organize and summarize that
information to get a conclusion. (b) shows how we design HVE to correspond to each
part of the human’s vision system.*
